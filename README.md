# gen
Generate (gen) is a command line tool to automate creation of script files, modification of file permissions, and input typical text.

Upcoming features:
  - Option to supress automatically launching editor (gen -s test.txt).
  - Handle expansions (gen test{00.99}.txt).
  - Option to select editor (gen -e emacs test.txt).
 
 Please send me any ideas for expanding scripting languages or features!
